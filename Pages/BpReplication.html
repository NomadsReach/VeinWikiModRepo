<h1>BP Replication/Dummying/Mimicking</h1>

<p>Blueprint (BP) Replication in Unreal Engine 4/5 involves creating blueprints and other assets that mimic the variables and structures of existing in-game blueprints. This method, also known as creating "dummy blueprints", allows modders to access and manipulate game variables without modifying the original assets.</p>

<p class="callout note"><strong>Note:</strong> This "replicating" is not overlapping with multiplayer replication. It's also known as asset dummying or mimicking process.</p>

<h2>Finding the BP we want to replicate</h2>

<p>For this example, we will replicate a <code>float</code> value within the player character BP.</p>

<p>Using FModel, I found this value.<br>
<em>(Note for UE5: <code>Double</code> is <code>float</code> in UE5)</em></p>

<p><img src="Pages/Media/replication/replication1.png" alt="Float Value"></p>

<p>And the base class of this blueprint is <code>Character</code> which we can see if we search for <code>SuperStruct</code> of the BP.</p>

<h2>Unreal Engine</h2>

<ol>
	<li>In UE, create the <strong>SAME</strong> folder structure as in the folder in FModel.</li>
	<li>Create a new BP of type <code>Character</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="Pages/Media/replication/replication3.png" alt="Create BP"></p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>Name the blueprint <strong>EXACTLY</strong> as in the game files.</li>
	<li>Double check the folders are identical.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
	<li>Create a new variable.</li>
	<li>Name it <strong>EXACTLY</strong> as shown in FModel, in this case it's <code>NormalJumpVelocity</code>.</li>
	<li>Set the correct type (in this case, it's <code>float</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some variables won't be using native types, so you will need to do more replication to be able to set them.</p>

<h2>Using It</h2>

<p>Open your mod bp, and access it directly. In this case, it's a variable within the character bp which we can get by getting the player character object and casting it to the correct BP type, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="Pages/Media/replication/replication6.png" alt="Access Variable"></p>

<p>This allows modders to directly access and change the value of assets within the game-files without modifying the original ones.</p>

<h3>About Replication</h3>

<p>This is not limited to variables, so you can replicate methods, delegates, any other type of assets, BP components, and even C++ headers.</p>

<h2>Packaging</h2>

<p>We don't package anything that was replicated! As this will result in overwriting the game-files which we don't want.</p>

<p>Only package the BP mod files.</p>
