<h1>Hotkeys in Blueprint</h1>

<p>For modders, hotkeys in Blueprints provide a way to execute additional logic when specific keys are pressed. This feature allows for the creation of custom in-game actions, shortcuts, and debug commands, enhancing the player's experience and testing efficiency.</p>

<h2>Event Graph</h2>
<p>The easiest way to monitor if a specific key is pressed is by using the following logic shown:</p>

<p>To monitor more keys, use the <code>Sequence</code> flow node.</p>

<p class="callout tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Useful for single use or togglable operations, like toggling a flashlight on and off.</p>

<h2>Macro</h2>
<p>The more keys you monitor, the messier it gets and to prevent "spaghetti code", it is recommended to use a custom Macro.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Left side panel, under the Macros section, press the <code>+</code> to create a new Macro and name it <code>KeyPressed</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="Pages/Media/HotKeys/3.png" alt="Create Macro"></p>

<ol start="2">
	<li>Create the shown inputs and outputs in the Macro.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="Pages/Media/HotKeys/4.png" alt="Macro Inputs/Outputs"></p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>Create the same logic as in the event graph, and connect the nodes as shown in the image.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="Pages/Media/HotKeys/5.png" alt="Macro Logic"></p>

<ol start="4">
	<li>Now the macro can be used in the event graph. It's much cleaner and easier to read and maintain.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key press and release</h3>
<p>If you need to monitor whenever a key is being pressed and released, create the following macro:</p>

<p class="callout tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Useful for toggling actions while holding the key, like using an in-game tool while a key is being pressed.</p>

<h3>Key down time</h3>
<p>If you need to monitor the time a certain key is being held down, create the following macro:</p>

<p class="callout tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Useful for events where the player needs to hold a key for X amount of seconds, like opening a door or quick-action sequences in cinematics.</p>
