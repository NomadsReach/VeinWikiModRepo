<h1>Config Variables</h1>

<p>Config variables allow mod users to configure certain variables of your mod outside of the game without any modding knowledge.</p>

<p class="callout note"><strong>Note:</strong> Config variables are under-rated in modding, hopefully it gets more popular over time.</p>

<h2>Enabling a config variable</h2>
<p>Enabling it is straightforward but can be easily missed as it's under the Advanced section of the variable settings.</p>

<h2>Using and configuring the variable</h2>
<p>All config variables can be set or overwritten by adding the mod's path as a header/section followed by the actual variables and their values.</p>

<p class="callout tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Config variables will be overwritten at runtime with the one set in the config file, so make sure you implement additional logic to ensure the value doesn't go outside of the expected range.</p>

<p>Hover over the Config Variable checkbox for more info:</p>
