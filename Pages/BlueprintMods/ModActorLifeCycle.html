<h1>ModActor life cycle</h1>

<p>Understanding the lifecycle of a ModActor (Actor Blueprint) in Unreal Engine is crucial for effective modding.</p>

<p>This guide will go through the basics of a blueprint.</p>

<h2>BeginPlay</h2>

<p>The <code>BeginPlay</code> method in a blueprint is typically called at the beginning of the actor's lifecycle. This event is fired once when the actor is spawned into the game world or when the game starts if the actor is already placed in the level.</p>

<h3>Key activities for BeginPlay</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Initialization: Set up initial properties, load game saves, create widgets, identify references, etc.</li>
	<li>Component Setup: Initialize and configure components like meshes, physics, and collision settings.</li>
	<li>Event Binding: Bind events to custom logic, such as handing player inputs or interactions.</li>
	<li>Spawn Related Actors: If your bp needs to spawn other actors then the <code>BeginPlay</code> node is an appropriate place to handle such spawns.</li>
</ul>

<p class="callout tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Use BeginPlay for setting initial values and loading assets.</p>

<h2>Tick</h2>

<p>The <code>Tick</code> method is called every frame, providing a way to update the actor's logic and handle real-time operations. This method is critical for tasks that require continuous updates, such as monitoring player input.</p>

<h3>Key activities for Tick</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Monitor Player Input: Continuously check and respond to player inputs, like movement commands or interaction requests.</li>
	<li>State Checking: Check for certain conditions like health thresholds, proximity to other actors, or specific game states.</li>
	<li>Timed Events: Manage events or actions that need to occur after specific intervals, such as cooldowns or scheduled actions.</li>
</ul>
