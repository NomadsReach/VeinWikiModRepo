<h1>Editing UMaps using Stove</h1>

<p>The tool can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/bananaturtlesandwich/stove" target="_blank">Stove</a> by <a href="https://github.com/bananaturtlesandwich" target="_blank">bananaturtlesandwich</a>.</p>

<p>Stove can be useful for moving, duplicating, or removing existing objects. Along with editing default values of objects, and even transplanting actors from a different umap.</p>

<p><em>It won't always work, but that's an additional option to edit <code>.umaps</code> to some extent.</em></p>

<h2>Loading UMaps</h2>

<p>Launch Stove, and before opening the <code>.umap</code>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Specify the Paks folder of the game.</li>
	<li>Specify the game's UE version.</li>
	<li>AES key (if any).</li>
</ul>

<p>Load the <code>.umap</code> you want, and you should see some kind of representation of the map, either just cube-shaped objects or cached meshes(both are fine).</p>

<p>If you know the name of the asset/actor, you can search for it in the top-left corner.</p>

<p>Compared to in-game, the camera position and navigation can be determined.</p>

<p>For this example, a few props will be duplicated to illustrate the basics of this tool. To duplicate the selected object, <code>Alt+Drag</code>.</p>

<p>The position can be manually adjusted if needed.</p>

<p>Additionally, Stove allows of editing of default values of selected objects, both blueprints and native UE components such as this desk lamp blueprint (spawn instance values, not global).</p>
