<h1>Importing UE Packed textures into Blender</h1>

<p>The guide will cover the traditional used textures for UE meshes, with base color, ORM, normal and emissive textures for each mesh. The industry standard for used textures in Unreal Engine models is having 3 textures: the base color (also called albedo), the ORM, and the normal map.</p>

<p>The "ORM" textures combine Occlusion, Roughness, and Metallic into a single texture, using the Red, Green, and Blue channels for efficiency. Some have emissive textures as well (the glowing parts of a mesh), but that's easy to handle.</p>

<p class="callout note"><strong>Note:</strong> Different games may have different sets of textures for each model, so this guide won't cover all of those, just the main general approach of textures in UE4/5.</p>

<h2>Blender</h2>

<p>Let's begin with dragging all the necessary textures into the shading node graph.</p>

<p class="callout note"><strong>Note:</strong> The guide uses Blender 3 as it's the same process, but Blender 4 differences are shown at the bottom of the guide.</p>

<h3>Preparing the Textures</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Import the mesh.</li>
	<li>Go to Shading tab and click <code>Use Nodes</code>.</li>
	<li>Drag and drop the textures for this mesh, usually it's color, ORM, Normal and sometimes Emissive texture.</li>
	<li>For ORM and Normal texture: set the <code>Color Space</code> to <code>Non-Color</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Connecting Base Color, Roughness, Metallic and Normal</h3>

<p>Connect the nodes as shown below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Base Color: connect the base color texture from Color to Base Color in BSDF.</li>
	<li>Packed/ORM texture: drag the Color and look for <code>Seperate Color</code> node.
		<ul>
			<li>Connect the color from the texture to Separate Color node color.</li>
			<li>Connect the Green to Roughness, and Blue to Metallic.</li>
			<li>We will handle the Red in the next step, leave it for now.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Normal map: Drag the color and look for <code>Normal Map Color</code> node, and connect the output Normal into Normal in BSDF.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding the Ambient Occlusion channel</h3>

<p>Adding the Ambient Occlusion from ORM is done by multiplying the base color by the red channel of the ORM texture.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Drag from base color and look for <code>Multiply Vector Math</code>.</li>
	<li>Connect Red from Seperate Color node to the second Vector of the Multiply node.</li>
	<li>Connect the output Vector to Base Color.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding Emissive texture (optional)</h3>

<p>If your model has an emissive texture, you can add it by using "Add Shader" node as shown below.</p>

<p class="callout note"><strong>Note:</strong> Blender 4 users - skip this, and scroll to the bottom of the guide, as this part is different.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Drag the BSDF and search for <code>Add Shader</code> node.</li>
	<li>Connect the output Shader into Surface in Material Output.</li>
	<li>Drag the emissive texture Color into the second Shader input.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some games have their emissive textures as white and adjusted in-game with the proper color code, which can be done in Blender by adjusting the color of the texture as shown below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Drag the emissive Color and search for <code>Color fac</code>, and connect as shown.</li>
	<li>Switch the mode to <code>Color</code>.</li>
	<li>Set the Fac to <code>1.000</code>.</li>
	<li>Adjust Color2 to your color of choice.</li>
	<li>And connect the output Color into the second Shader in Add Shader.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blender 4 Differences</h2>

<p>The process in Blender 4 is similar besides the emissive which is connected directly into the BSDF's Emission input, as shown below.</p>
