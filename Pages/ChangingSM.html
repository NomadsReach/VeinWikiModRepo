<h1>Changing StaticMeshes</h1>

<p>The process is similar to texture swap but with a few additions of materials and textures.</p>

<p>This guide requires Blender and a Blender PSK-plugin to be able to import the <code>.psk</code> files which are exported from FModel/UModel.<br>
Blender is free and available on <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender website</a> or on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/365670/Blender/" target="_blank">Steam page (Blender)</a>.</p>

<p>The plugin link: <a href="https://github.com/DarklightGames/io_scene_psk_psa" target="_blank">io_scene_psk_psa</a>.<br>
<em>(download the correct version, and follow the instructions in that repo readme)</em></p>

<p>Note: This guide uses the <a href="https://github.com/Befzz/blender3d_import_psk_psa" target="_blank">older version</a> for Blender v3, so it might look slightly different.</p>

<h3>Finding the model in FModel</h3>

<p>For this example, this fuel-tank model will be replaced with a <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sci-fi-crate-now-free-8a8f77af0de14630b94d2cda49823a74" target="_blank">Sci-fi crate</a> model from Sketchfab.</p>

<p>Once you found the model, Right-click &rarr; Save Model.<br>
Which will save the model as <code>.psk</code> file.</p>

<h3>Blender time!</h3>

<p>Using the plugin, import the <code>.psk</code> file <u>without</u> scaling down.<br>
(in the newer plugin and Blender 4, keep the scale to 1.0)<br>
(in old plugin, untick ScaleDown)</p>

<p>Import your custom model, and scale it to fit the original proportions.</p>

<p>Move the new mesh to the center, rename it to match the original name, and remove the old/original mesh.<br>
Then export as <code>.fbx</code> file, and scale it down to <code>0.01</code> (in export settings).</p>

<h3>Unreal Engine</h3>

<p>Launch UE and create the same folder structure as in-game.<br>
Then drag and drop the <code>.fbx</code> file, and let it import the associated textures.</p>

<p>This step consists of importing any missing textures, creating the materials, and organizing the files a bit.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Import any textures you need (as it doesn't always load all of them).</li>
	<li>Rename the static mesh to <strong>match the original file as in FModel</strong>!</li>
	<li>Create and assign the materials (look up on youtube on how to work with materials).</li>
	<li>Renaming textures/materials and organizing (you don't have to, but it will be easier to maintain and work with).
		<ul>
			<li>It's recommended to follow the best-practice naming conventions.</li>
			<li>Where Textures start with <code>T_</code>, materials with <code>M_</code> and static meshes with <code>SM_</code>.</li>
			<li>And moving all custom textures/materials into their own folder, for this example; <code>crate</code> folder.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Packaging and in-game results</h3>

<p>Once the materials are created, assigned, and named - Pack the mod.</p>

<p>For more information about how to package your mod, view <a href="#Pages/CookingContent.html">Cooking Content guide</a>.<br>
(don't forget to name your mod with <code>_P</code> in its name)</p>
