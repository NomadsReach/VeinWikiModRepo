<h1>Changing Textures</h1>

<p>For this example, a sword texture for GR2 (UE4.27) will be changed, but the same principles apply to any other game and engine version.</p>

<p>Once you located the texture you want to replace, export it as PNG and edit it to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Launch UE and create the same folder structure as it's shown in FModel.</p>

<p>Import the texture(s) into its folder and keep the <strong>same exact</strong> name as it's named in FModel.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br>
Try and match any texture settings you override with its original type.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If it's a <code>Normal</code> map texture, make sure you pick NormalMap in CompressionSettings.</li>
	<li>If it's an ORM (packed Occlusion|Roughness|Metalic into one), make sure you pick Masks in CompressionSettings.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can double-check everything in FModel.</p>

<p>Once done, simply pack it and test it in-game.<br>
